# Go Chat Application

This Go chat application provides real-time communication between users through websockets. It's built using the Go programming language and leverages the `gorilla/websocket` package for managing websocket connections. The application is designed to be simple, efficient, and easy to deploy and run.

## Features

- Real-time chat communication.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.
- Supports multiple users simultaneously.

## Prerequisites

Before you run or deploy the chat application, ensure you have the following installed:
- Go (version 1.13 or later recommended)
- Access to a terminal or command line interface

## Getting Started

To get the chat application running locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**

   First, clone this repository to your local machine using Git.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Run the application**

   From the root of your project directory, run the application using the `go run` command. This will start the server on the default port `8080`.

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

   Optionally, you can specify a different port by providing it as an argument:

   ```bash
   go run main.go 8081
   ```

3. **Access the chat application**

   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` (or the port you specified). You should see the chat application's user interface.

## Deploying to a Server

To deploy the chat application to a server, follow these general steps. Note that specific steps may vary based on your hosting provider and server configuration.

1. **Build the application**

   Compile your application to a binary for your server's OS and architecture.

   ```bash
   go build -o chat-app
   ```

2. **Transfer the binary and resources**

   Transfer the compiled binary and any necessary resources (like the `public` directory, if you have a frontend component) to your server.

3. **Run the application**

   On your server, start the application. You might want to use a process manager like `systemd` or `supervisord` to keep your application running after closing the terminal.

   ```bash
   ./chat-app
   ```

   Ensure the server's firewall rules allow traffic on the port your application is listening on.
